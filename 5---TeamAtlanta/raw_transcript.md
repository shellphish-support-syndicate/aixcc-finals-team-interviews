# CTF Radio - Team Atlanta AI Cyber Challenge Interview

## Introduction

**Adam:** Hello everyone. Welcome to CTF radio. In another crazy bit of CTF radio trivia, we've now shattered our record for most number of interviews done and episodes recorded in a two week span. We're at five right now. So Yan, can you give the people what they want? We need you to bring that energy because we're doing all this recording.

**Yan:** Hello hackers. Why did you clap? Why would you clap? That's terrible. There's no need to clap. The clapping is great. The clapping makes it so people can seek into my part, which is of course where everyone starts. No, I'm super excited. We are basically recording non-stop. I see Adam on the other side of my screen basically every day, half the day or more. It's a dream come true.

**Adam:** But that should be normal. We work together. We literally have research meetings together.

**Yan:** That's true. But sometimes, you know, you can lock yourself in an office. And because you also have access to my office, I can also hold the handle. I have a key code. My key card opens your office. So I don't know. That was your choice by the way. I hold the candle and the handle and barricade the door.

**Adam:** Yeah, sure. You can when you're on the screen. There's no escape. I can call you. I can FaceTime you, man.

**Yan:** That's true. See, this is the beauty of our working relationship.

**Adam:** I was going to say our toxic codependence, but go ahead.

**Yan:** Exactly. No, it has been super awesome. We've been, like you said, spending weeks talking to all of the teams in the ICC and this session, it's the second to last one that we're talking to and then the last...

**Adam:** We have three more. We have one scheduled.

**Yan:** That's right. That's right. We still have one to schedule. We have one more scheduled and this is our...

**Adam:** Yes. Yes. Yes. But anyways, that's why I'm drinking coffee in the evening.

## Background and Team Context

**Yan:** But it's very cool. We mentioned this a lot. But in the Cyber Grand Challenge, which of course was 10 years ago, precursor to the ICC, the stories, a lot of the stories didn't get told. And there was an enormous amount of stories to tell. But of course after the competition everyone is looking to what the new thing is. Probably after the ICC have the teams are going to basically create the next massive AI startup or something and then you'll have forgotten about the competition itself.

But so it's really cool that there's this gap between pencils down - you're done writing the cyber reasoning system - to who won, and in this gap stories can occur. So today very excited to hear the story of team Atlanta who you see on the screen alongside us. Team Atlanta, the people involved are people that we have been academically friendly and collaborating with and hanging out with and partying at conferences for decades, definitely cumulatively and especially with some of the more senior leadership. So I'm super excited to talk to them.

**Adam:** Yeah that's great. Thanks for that introduction. So we have before we get into the team itself we have four great members of team Atlanta here. So why don't we go around. Taesoo, why don't you introduce yourself first to the good people.

## Team Introductions

**Taesoo:** Okay. First of all, thank you for your dedication. That's your amazing efforts. Okay. I really appreciate what you're doing. I always admire what you're doing for community particular AIC. That's great. I'm Taesoo Kim. I'm currently professor at Georgia Tech as well as VP at Samsung Research. Samsung research always want me to say those when I be present in public space.

At the same time team Atlanta as you can see from the name most of the team member are from Georgia Tech. There are many people, my PhD students, some people are graduated from Georgia Tech. So we are everyone's rooted from Georgia Tech in some way or another. At that many of the team member are leader in their own organizations. We are multi-organizational group consisting of KAIST, one of the university in South Korea and POSTECH, previously NYU and we also have some company involved like Samsung research and Samsung research America so we have an interesting mix of all these practitioners and in some of the programmers, engineers and many of PhD student and postdoc working together.

**Adam:** That's great. Yeah, I think most of the teams that we've seen are either kind of solidly either academic or industry based. So I'll be interested as we talk more of diving into like how that dynamic works. So great. Why don't who wants to go next to introduce themselves?

**Hanqing:** I can go next please. I'm Hanqing. I'm from Georgia Tech SSLab. I actually, I'm a CTF player as well. I played CTF. I started playing CTF from 12 years ago and I have ever played CTF with team blue Lotus, loop and later team deliverers. Right now in this AIC competition I lead a team focusing on C and C++ bug finding system. We have around five to six people and we made a bug finding system specifically for C and C++.

**Adam:** Nice. Awesome. What's your... Do you have a hacker handle since you're a CTF player?

**Hanqing:** Yes. My handle is hanqing95.

**Adam:** Nice. 95 because you're such a fan of Windows 95.

**Hanqing:** Oh, that's my birth birthday.

**Yan:** God, Yan, why'd you have to do that? You share a birthday, a birth year with Windows.

**Adam:** Well, not technically, but anyways, Windows 95 was the pinnacle of computing. Let's move on from Windows 95. I don't know why we're there.

**Yan:** Because of you.

**Adam:** All right. Great. Well, thank you. Welcome. Welcome. Minwoo, what about you? You want to introduce yourself?

**Minwoo:** Hi, I am Minwoo, a PhD student in KAIST advised by Insu Yun who's our team lead of the patching team, and I'm also part of the patching team. And there's around 10 of us in the patching team and I'm glad to be here to introduce what we did for around two years I guess.

**Adam:** Yeah. Awesome. Great. So if the patching works well, it was your success and if it went wrong, it was those other nine peoples, right?

**Minwoo:** It's Insu's fault.

**Adam:** Just not here. He wasn't able to join us today. All right. HyungSeok, you want to introduce yourself?

**HyungSeok:** Yeah. Hi, I'm HyungSeok. I'm currently working at a security research team in Samsung research America and previously I was a postdoc in Taesoo's lab in Georgia Tech. That's why I joined the team. At the automatic bug finding team especially for C, C++ and Java and while doing that I also put my many effort to integrate all the system and make them working.

**Adam:** So yeah it was not just working right, working together. That's like the hardest part is what we've been we know from doing it but also from talking to the team we can talk about lot of drama at the end also was we have to wake up every single member in passing teams like 5AM South Korea kind of the last minute hiccup.

## Team Structure and Communication

**Adam:** Okay, this is great. Okay, so then give us the... So we got a little bit of details. So roughly like how big is the team? I think it helps kind of frame things. So you have several different organizations and as you mentioned geographically distributed as well. So what's roughly like the size of the team?

**Taesoo:** We have about 30 people or 30 and more people working together across countries.

**Adam:** Nice. And is that are these people like all... I know some teams did like they had like a core of 10 and then they'd have some kind of people that would work part-time. Is this like 30 core people working full-time on this?

**Taesoo:** So we intentionally didn't divide the team members in that way. So we although half of team members are student, okay student is far from full-time, when you're talking to students. Yeah, I have a final exam they have to work on. Final project or research paper deadline. So extremely hard to deal with this part-time student. But I think they're smart. They can find their own needs in the team. They can play their own role. But I would say half of team member are student and postdoc, about 10 people or slightly more than 10 people are full-time engineer. I think this is one of the big strength of our team. I think I had a hard time convincing Samsung to dedicate resource so that we can at least reserve that much of time, that much of engineer for the duration of competition.

**Adam:** Yeah, that's really cool. And it also the PhD students kind of reminded me of what Yan talks about with the cyber grand challenge. I think that was kind of your approach, right? It was you were doing cyber grand challenge but also you were doing normal PhD stuff.

**Yan:** Yeah, it was just normal. You have a deadline like the cyber grand challenge quals is happening and there's a USENIX deadline. It's like exactly.

**Adam:** I think this time we are... I think I have to clarify a little bit. We are open track meaning that we didn't get the funding directly from DARPA to prepare this competition. In other word we have to find some of the resources to fund our PhD student which was tricky. We have to deal with this sponsor project while working on this competition as well. There's so much practical challenges behind.

**Adam:** Yeah, that's great. So can you talk a little bit? I think you mentioned it but was it and this is also why in case people were... Yan made the joke about drinking coffee late at night. We are recording this at 7:00 and the only reason I mentioned this is because you know I think to do this to accommodate your team right because you are geographically located. So how did you kind of structure the communication of the team to handle like were you all doing I don't know zoom meetings or was it hard to meet synchronously was it asynchronous maybe you could talk about the communication style of the team.

**Taesoo:** I think we also realized that communicating asynchronously through Slack is most effective way to communicate. We realized that working collecting all team member together. In fact this week is a workshop for the entire team member discussing and pitching about their new idea and what we did during the competition. Right now this internal workshop that we are doing every day until next week but collecting all the team member in the single place in a single time zone or near impossible. So that we intentionally divide team in a way that they have a similar time zone so that they can make smaller team get together and talk on Slack. The telecommunication system in Slack, they can just talk casually, but we try to reduce the amount of team wise communication as much as possible.

**Adam:** Nice. Yeah, that totally makes sense. And actually, I think we probably didn't get into it in the Shellfish interview, Yan, but I know that the Shellfish team kind of did that in essence because you had the three universities and so you'd almost naturally kind of coalesce one university like a subgroup maybe in there was working on the same thing because it's so easy when you're all there working on the same thing.

**Yan:** I think as the competition went on, it was more and more cross university just because they were more used to working with each other. But yeah, it's easier to work with people that are near you. My understanding is the early version of our patching system on shellfish for example is very much single university, two different single university systems and then they merged and grew together. The difference is though everyone's in the US on Shellfish and so Shellfish was able to gather very regularly in single some third party places right like big Airbnbs and stuff. I think you guys had an extra challenge there.

**Adam:** That's quite... we have a former student who's a professor in Korea and finding a time to meet that's not in the middle of the night for him and not in the middle of like right during dinner time or something for us is tough.

## Cyber Reasoning System Architecture

**Adam:** Wow. Interesting. Now let's get into the cyber reasoning system. Of course, the reason why we're all here. So, first question, what's the name of your CRS?

**Taesoo:** I think HyungSeok came up with the idea. Our CRS name is Atlantis the hero.

**Adam:** Oh, that's great. He probably asked ChatGPT.

**Taesoo:** I think that's the best we can think of. We are not very creative. So we leverage the creativity of LLM. One thing we actually realized during the competitions as well the creativity the human has is not comparable to the creativity the computer has. So I think creativity is not the unique thing for human.

**Adam:** Interesting. Wow. Bold words. Bold words. Okay. So Atlantis, is that a... is that just the name or is it like an acronym that backfills into something?

**Taesoo:** ChatGPT can make a backfill work pretty well.

**Yan:** Yeah, the sorry the question was if Atlantis is like an acronym or is it just the system is just called Atlantis and that's your final answer.

**Taesoo:** I think we vaguely call the entire system is Atlantis but internally there are I would say different maybe five different major component working together. I think I can briefly explain the architectures of what we did.

**Adam:** Yeah, that'd be great like as a high level overview and then we can dig in.

**Taesoo:** I think I can explain some historic aspect of our system as well. Previously in the semifinal major focus is a Linux kernel and user space program. So our CRS naturally divided into kernel focus which HyungSeok was leading and user space CRS that Hanqing was leading at the time and there was Java side as well. But when the competition evolved, kernel spaces naturally disappear because the compatibility is no longer OS project. So we retarget the entire kernel people into what we call multi-language systems that target both C and Java at the same time while keeping two specialized CRS for C and Java alongside there is a patching system universally handle both the requests in two different languages and there are sheriff team that handle the validity of the sheriff so basically five big team collaborating together in CRS development.

**Adam:** Nice. Okay so then what what were the kind of techniques that you employed like in those kind of at a high level...

**Yan:** Could we even back up a little bit? You said basically name three different cyber reasoning systems. Were they in the end three separate systems or a single meta system that had three massive components?

**Taesoo:** That's a great questions. We intentionally... I'll say our team relatively bigger than the other I guess so that we intentionally divide the systems in order to manner. If C space CRS design for C doesn't work we hope that multi-language CRS can handle. So these are three system working really independently. So there's a C component and Java component and there is baseline component where we call multi-language. They really working independently but there of course there is a API layer that communicate with the organization but internally there is a really separate component.

**Yan:** Did you ever do contests between the different CRS's because you basically did this three times. Hey you fired one of the teams that didn't do well.

**Taesoo:** Right. Exactly. There's only space for two cyber reasoning systems in our cyber reasoning system. I think that so one of philosophy that we have we have a benchmark systems probably any other people have as well. We can compare the performance between two CRS. But wh
