# CTF Radio - Team Atlanta AI Cyber Challenge Interview

## Introduction

**Adam:** Hello everyone. Welcome to CTF radio. In another crazy bit of CTF radio trivia, we've now shattered our record for most number of interviews done and episodes recorded in a two week span. We're at five right now. So Yan, can you give the people what they want? We need you to bring that energy because we're doing all this recording.

**Yan:** Hello hackers. Why did you clap? Why would you clap? That's terrible. There's no need to clap. The clapping is great.

**Adam:** We have three more. We have one scheduled.

**Yan:** That's right. That's right. We still have one to schedule. We have one more scheduled and this is our...

**Adam:** Yes. Yes. Yes. But anyways, that's why I'm drinking coffee in the evening.

## Background and Team Context

**Yan:** But it's very cool. We mentioned this a lot. But in the Cyber Grand Challenge, which of course was 10 years ago, precursor to the ICC, the stories, a lot of the stories didn't get told. And there was an enormous amount of stories to tell. But of course after the competition everyone is looking to what the new thing is. Probably after the ICC have the teams are going to basically create the next massive AI startup or something and then you'll have forgotten about the co
